Seeing if I can improve the R markdown output

Lets load some data, we'll use the BLAST output from Rob
```{r}
Random<-readr::read_csv("C:/Users/tommy/Documents/rebecca/Coding training/random table for practice.csv")
head(Random)
ggplot(data=Random)
ggplot(data=Random)+geom_point(aes(x=Person, y=Height))
#Code from Tom
dev.new() ; plot(Random$Height , xlab = 'ghsdfj')
dev.new() ; barplot(Random$Height , xlab = 'ghsdfj')
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I'm going to try to do a barchart now
```{r}
ggplot(RobBLAST)+geom_bar(aes(y=Height))
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
